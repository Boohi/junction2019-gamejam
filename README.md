## Junction 2019 - gamejam

Game jam invites you to reach the full potential of your creativeness! In general the game can be anything - a platformer, mobile or VR game, there is no requirement on specific technology or genre, but your game must somehow include the given topic. 

The topic for Game Jam this year is the following: 

## 'New is old, and old is new".' 

Also, use Junction 2019 theme colours in a creative way: The colours in hexadecimal rgb are #B200B7, #770578, #f38100, #DB682E'

## Enter: BattleMail

Battle mail is PBeM (Play By eMail) game, where players fiercely fight each other on the fields of glory. According to the theme, we combined a new-ish gameplay element (party game) with old and clunky controls (email).
